This course is an introduction to basic electronic test equipment commonly used in building and debugging circuits. In addition, the reader will also become familiar with the usage of breadboards, a common circuit prototyping material. 

The test equipment covered will include multimeters, DC power supplies and oscilloscopes, with a short section on logic analysers. 

Although this course material can be consumed without having the above equipment, it is still **recommended** to have a set on-hand for the full experience. The best way to learn how to use electronic equipment is to keep using them! (press all the buttons)
